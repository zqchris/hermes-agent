"""Gateway streaming consumer — bridges sync agent callbacks to async platform delivery.

The agent fires stream_delta_callback(text) synchronously from its worker thread.
GatewayStreamConsumer:
  1. Receives deltas via on_delta() (thread-safe, sync)
  2. Queues them to an asyncio task via queue.Queue
  3. The async run() task buffers, rate-limits, and progressively edits
     a single message on the target platform

Design: Uses the edit transport (send initial message, then editMessageText).
This is universally supported across Telegram, Discord, and Slack.
